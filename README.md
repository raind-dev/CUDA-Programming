# 🚀 CUDA Programming Examples & Practice

This repository collects my personal hands-on experiments and implementations related to **GPU programming** using:

- **C/C++ with CUDA**
- **Python with Numba**

The goal is to deepen understanding of parallel computing, GPU acceleration techniques, and real-world applications.
